 *
 * This file implements intern(), which clones and interns
 * an arbitrary graph of objects into a referenced-counted heap.
 *
 * Interning a graph of acyclic objects is trivial: recursively intern
 * referenced objects, replacing each reference with its canonical interned
 * pointer value. Then intern the raw bits for the object in the global
 * internTable. This always yields the right answer.
 *
 * We optimize the simplest case, interning a single acyclic object
 * (perhaps containing references to already-interned acyclic objects).
 * We look it up in the intern table without allocating any memory.
 * If it's not found then of course we must allocate a shallow clone and
 * insert that in the global internTable.
 *
 * It's interning cycles that is hard.
 *
 * Interning a cycle raises an obvious representation question: how do we
 * support reference-counted cycles without those reference counts causing a
 * memory leak?  This is the classic problem with reference-counted garbage
 * collection.  The trick, which only works because interned objects are
 * immutable, is that we identify cycles at interning time and mark each object
 * as a "cycle member" (see IObj::isCycleMember()) and delegate all of their
 * reference counting to the same object, a CycleHandle (see
 * IObj::refcountDelegate()). Intra-cycle references are not counted. When the
 * CycleHandle's reference count hits zero, that means no one is referencing any
 * member of the cycle, and the entire cycle is freed (i.e. the cycle lives and
 * dies as one).
 *
 * The graph of objects being interned may contain any combination of cyclic and
 * acyclic references, linked together in arbitrary ways. It's actually
 * surprisingly challenging to intern all cases correctly, but we do.
 *
 * The first step is to tease apart the graph into separately internable
 * subgraphs. Each subgraph is a "strongly connected component" (SCC), basically
 * a maximal group of objects where every object can "reach" every other object
 * by following references. In the common case of no cycles, each object forms
 * its own separate SCC.
 *
 * [Terminology note: whenever we say "cycle" we really mean "an SCC with cyclic
 * references", not the various sub-cycles that exist in a larger SCC.]
 *
 * [Terminology note: whenever we say objects are "equal", we really mean
 * "isomorphic". Object identity is not meaningful and all we care about is
 * local state in the object and what other objects are reachable from it.]
 *
 * To partition into SCCs we use Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components
 * algorithm
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
 * This has the added benefit of topologically sorting the objects, so we
 * process children before the parents that point to them, which makes the
 * acyclic case easy.
 *
 * As a building block for the below algorithms, we have a deepCompare()
 * function which takes two objects and returns less than, equal, or
 * greater than, depending on the "local state" of the objects (class
 * type plus non-reference fields) and the local state of all objects
 * transitively reachable from them.  This imposes a total ordering on all graph
 * nodes. If this returns "equal" then the two objects are indistinguishable in
 * every way (there is no chain of pointers you can follow in the two objects to
 * find any difference in local state).
 *
 * To understand deepCompare()'s ordering, each object logically has a "sort
 * key" consisting of the (possibly infinite) "string" of local states reachable
 * from that object by doing a breadth-first walk which does not terminate when
 * it returns to a node already visited. The ordering on such strings, like any
 * strings, is transitive. It turns out that comparing two such nodes via BFS
 * walk does terminate, because we can do some short-circuiting without
 * affecting the semantically correct result -- there is never a need to place
 * any pair of pointers being compared on the BFS deque more than once, because
 * if there is any difference in state reachable from those two nodes, the copy
 * "earlier" in the BFS queue will find it first.
 *
 * There are two tricky interning cases:
 *
 * (A) The SCC points to an already-interned cycle, which is actually isomorphic
 *     to the SCC being interned, as in Examples 1 and 2 below. Surprisingly,
 *     interning a single-object SCC that does not point to itself can yield
 *     a cycle!
 *
 * (B) The SCC contains a cycle, either a single object pointing to itself or
 *     multiple objects.
 *
 * So the algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * (1) Check to see if (A) or (B) may be possible. A single-object SCC
 *     which only points to pre-interned acyclic objects (isDefinitelyAcyclic())
 *     cannot possibly hit either case, and so can be trivially interned by
 *     hashing its raw bytes, including the pointers to those interned objects.
 *
 * Otherwise:
 *
 * (2) Detect case (A): if any object in the SCC points to an already-interned
 *     cycle, maybe that object is equal to something in the SCC. To check, we
 *     find all predecessors of the already-interned object and deepCompare()
 *     them to the object being interned. If none are equal, we continue looking
 *     for more references to other cycles (we do not need to consider this
 *     cycle again.) But if we find a match, we have successfully interned this
 *     SCC, because if ANY object in the SCC is isomorphic to an interned
 *     object, all of the rest must be as well, and we can derive that mapping
 *     by recursively walking through the two isomorphic nodes' children in
 *     lockstep, mapping one to the other. This works even if there are
 *     duplicates in the SCC as in Example 4.
 *
 * (3) If step (2) didn't find anything, we need to look up the SCC in
 *     internTable. This requires some preprocessing to figure out exactly
 *     what we are going to look up:
 *
 *     (a) Create the localHashToNodes table by partitioning the objects in the
 *         SCC by their "local hashes", i.e. by hashing their raw byte contents
 *         *excluding* references which are not isDefinitelyAcyclic().
 *
 *     (b) Remove duplicate objects, as in Example 4, to put the SCC in
 *         canonical form. We find them by separately quicksorting the nodes in
 *         each partition of localHashToNodes, using deepCompare() as the
 *         comparator. Any object which is equal to the pivot at any step of the
 *         quicksort is discarded.
 *
 *     (c) Select a "cycle root". We *could* intern the graph many times,
 *         "starting at" every object in the graph, but it's smaller and cleaner
 *         to only intern it once, from the perspective of a single object,
 *         which we call the "root". The root is chosen in a way that anyone
 *         interning any object in any isomorphic SCC will also choose the same
 *         root, and hence look it up the same way (matching hash/equality).
 *         The root selection algorithm doesn't really matter as long as it's
 *         consistent; we happen to use the "first" object according to
 *         quicksort in the localHashToNodes partition with the smallest hash,
 *         which will be identical for any isomorphic SCC.
 *
 *     (d) Create a CycleHandle "wrapping" the cycle root and look it up in
 *         internTable. Its hash is formed by doing a DFS from the root and
 *         hashing in each SCC member it encounters, only visiting each child
 *         once. We also hash in information about the order in which each child
 *         is visited, in case we hash a degenerate graph which only has
 *         references and no distinguishing local hash state. internTable
 *         equality is done by recursing from the root using deepCompare().
 *
 *     (e) If we find the SCC in internTable, reuse it. Otherwise set up
 *         various bits of bookkeeping properly and insert it into the table.
 *
 * See also "DFA minimization", which is a related but non-incremental
 * algorithm.
 *
 * Here are some examples of tricky cases:
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *          uninterned      #    already interned
 *          ------------    #    ----------------
 *                          #
 *                          #         +---+
 *                          #         |   |
 *               (7)---------------->(7)<-+
 *                          #
 *                          #
 *                          #
 *                          #
 *
 * Here we have an already-interned object with a single field "7" and a
 * reference to itself, and we want to intern a new object which also has a
 * field "7" that points to the already-interned object. These two objects are
 * equal (isomorphic), since each object has an "7" field and points to an
 * infinite chain of objects with "7" fields.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *          uninterned      #    already interned
 *          ------------    #    ----------------
 *                          #         +------+
 *                          #         |      |
 *                          #         v      |
 *            +->(7)---------------->(8)<-+  |
 *            |   |         #         |   |  |
 *            |   |         #         |   |  |
 *            |   v         #         v   |  |
 *            +--(8)        #        (7)--+--+
 *
 * A more complex case of the problem in Example 1. The uninterned SCC
 * is equal to an already-interned SCC that it points to.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *          uninterned      #    already interned
 *          ------------    #    ----------------
 *                          #
 *            +->(7)        #        (8)<-+
 *            |   |         #         |   |
 *            |   |         #         |   |
 *            |   v         #         v   |
 *            +--(8)        #        (7)--+
 *
 * These two cycles are equal, but we may have previously interned
 * the cycle starting at a different node. No matter which node we look
 * up ((7) or (8)), we need to find the corresponding node in the pre-interned
 * cycle rather than making a new cycle.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 *          uninterned      #    already interned
 *          ------------    #    ----------------
 *                          #
 *           (7)---+        #      +---+
 *            ^    |        #      |   |
 *            |    v        #     (7)<-+
 *            + --(7)       #
 *
 *
 * Here the graph being interned has internal redundancy that needs to be
 * removed: the two (7) values are equal to each other and need to be combined
 * before looking up the cycle in the intern table.
