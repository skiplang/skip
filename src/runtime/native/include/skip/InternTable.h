 * An IObj* plus some tag bits used by the InternTable.
 *
 * The low two bits are a skip::SpinLock, used to lock a Bucket.
 * They are only used in the head of the list, i.e. the pointer stored
 * directly in the buckets_ array.
 *
 * The remaining tag bits (17 on x86_64) store additional bits of the hash
 * of the pointed-to object, to accelerate lookups and rehashing.

 * Specifically, because an InternTable has at least
 * (1 << InternTable::kLog2MinBuckets) buckets, at least the low kLog2MinBuckets
 * of the hash are always implied by the bucket containing the object, and
 * all objects in that bucket must share those hash bits.
 *
 * Recording the extra hash bits "just above" the implied ones gives us
 * some useful information to accelerate rehashing, and lets us quickly weed
 * out objects on lookup that can't possibly be equal because their "extra"
 * hash bits do not match those of the full size_t hash being looked up.

/**
 * This is a hash table used to intern Skip objects (IObj*).
 *
 * It uses an intrusive linked list of objects per bucket with per-bucket
 * locking via a skip::SpinLock.
 *
 * Each pointer in the chain uses leftover "tag bits" to hold additional
 * bits of the hash of the pointed-to object. There is no need to even
 * compare against the object unless those tag bits match the corresponding
 * bits of the hash being looked up.
 *
 * The table uses an interesting lazy rehashing trick. Memory for all the
 * buckets it might ever use is mmap()ed up front, but most of the pages
 * are not "touched". Although this consumes a great deal of address space,
 * that is cheap on a 64-bit platform, and it does not actually consume any
 * physical memory (just a single struct vm_area_struct in the Linux kernel
 * for the entire range).
 *
 * A NULL value in a bucket (the default from the zero page shared by all
 * the untouched pages) means "this bucket needs to be rehashed into from its
 * parent lower-numbered bucket". An actual empty list uses a different
 * sentinel value. When a NULL bucket is locked, we also lock its parent
 * (found by turning off the highest set bit in the bucket index), then
 * partition the bucket entries between the two buckets. This process may
 * recurse if the parent is also NULL.
 *
 * When the table gets too full we simply double the number of active buckets
 * (i.e. the bit-AND mask applied to the hash to find the bucket), and do
 * nothing else. Over time the newly-accessible buckets will get lazily
 * populated with the correct contents when they are first accessed.
